# IOT-Medical-Report üè•


## Overview üåü
**IOT-Medical-Report** is an innovative solution designed to assist in the processing and understanding of medical reports. By using advanced machine learning and AI models, this project extracts text from uploaded medical documents (like scanned reports) and generates easy-to-understand explanations for users. It helps insurance professionals, medical practitioners, and families to interpret complex medical data and decide on the legitimacy of claims.

Currently, the project processes **scanned medical reports** and provides a summary of the extracted text. The support for **X-ray** and **MRI scan** processing is still under development.

---

## Features ‚ú®
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Extracts text from scanned medical reports (PDFs, PNG, JPG, JPEG).
- **Medical Report Summarization**: Automatically summarizes the extracted text in simple terms.
- **Medical Condition Identification**: Identifies possible medical conditions mentioned in the report.
- **Simplified Explanations**: Provides an easy-to-understand explanation of medical conditions for users, especially those without a technical background.
- **Support for Insurance Claims**: Helps insurance professionals verify if medical claims are legitimate based on the content of the reports.

### Future Features (Under Development) üöÄ
- **X-ray & MRI Scan Analysis**: Integration of machine learning models to analyze X-ray and MRI scans alongside medical records for better insights.
